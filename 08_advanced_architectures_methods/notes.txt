Bethany's talk

We've seen mainly classification models so far. There are also regression models (for predicting a real number), or clustering models. Reinforcement learning is useful for 'delayed reward' schemes.

AI goals:
searching, reasoning, language processing, perception, dimensionality reduction, anamoly detection.

Types:
recurrent neural network layer (see bonusmaterial 04 image time series
"Transformer" models.

physics-inspired (see bonusmaterial 07 inspired AI)

Generative adverserial networks
Diffusion models

Auto-encoders.
