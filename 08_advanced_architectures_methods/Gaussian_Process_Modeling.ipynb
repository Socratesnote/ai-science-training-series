    "- A Gaussian process can be thought of as a multi-variate normal distribution in an infinite-dimensional space of functions (e.g. a Hilbert space, Fourier space...). Essentially a \"probability distribution over functions.\"     \n",

    "- This seemingly harmless generalization has surprising super-powers.  For example, given sample values from an unknown function, a GP can be trained to give an updated distribution over functions that captures information from the data!  \n",
